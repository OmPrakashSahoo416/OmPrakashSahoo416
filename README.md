Hi, I'm Om Prakash Sahoo from India.

I’m an AI engineer with over 2.5 years of experience at Hughes Systique Corporation’s Center of Excellence (CoE), where I work on AI-driven systems, deep learning research, and intelligent application development. My work bridges innovation and real-world deployment — from neural receivers and LLM-based wireless Q&A systems to AI-powered web tools and real-time collaborative platforms.

My expertise includes deep learning, computer vision, and applied AI, leveraging architectures like Transformers, CNNs, and RNNs for tasks such as depth estimation, beamforming intelligence, and adaptive learning models. I’m also experienced in full-stack development using React, Redux, Node.js, Firebase, and Next.js, enabling seamless integration of AI into user-facing applications.

I hold a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from Odisha University of Technology and Research, Bhubaneswar (2023).
Let’s connect to discuss AI research, intelligent system design,
