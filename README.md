Hi, I'm **Om Prakash Sahoo** from India.

As a passionate software engineer with over a year of experience, I currently contribute to Hughes Systique Corporationâ€™s Center of Excellence (CoE) team. Our team, dedicated to research and development, is at the forefront of innovation. My role encompasses  full stack development and backend work with Firebase, NodeJS, etc. allowing me to build robust and user-friendly applications.

In addition to my development work, I delve into deep learning projects. I have hands-on experience with depth estimation, neural receivers, and creating a ChatGPT-like application tailored for wireless knowledge Q&A. This blend of development and cutting-edge AI projects keeps me engaged and constantly learning.

I hold a B. Tech in Electrical Engineering from Odisha University of Technology and Research, Bhubaneswar, where I graduated in 2023. My academic background provides a strong foundation in problem-solving and technical skills, which I continually apply in my professional journey.

Feel free to connect with me to discuss technology.
